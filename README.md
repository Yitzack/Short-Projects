## Alice_Bob

Networking experiment to implement public key encryption, symmetric key encryption, authentication, and communication between multiple clients and a server.

## Det_Sim

Detination simulation where I blow up a simulated concrete bunker with a simulated explosion.

## Lorentz_Monte_Carlo

Integrate one or more Lorentz peaks in one or more dimensions using Monte Carlo methods

## Mandelbrot

Plot the Mandelbrot set using C++, Java, and Python.

## Pi_Monte_Carlo

Calculate pi using Monte Carlo methods by throwing points into a unit N-cube and seeing how many land in the inscribed unit N-ball. Written in C++ and Rust.

## Prime_Count

Count the number of primes up to some limit in several ways and which is faster.

## Skydweller

Technical interview questions for a job at Skydweller. They are looking to unman a solar powered airplane to keep it flying so long as the parts don't fail. One task is to simulate an airplane taking off and how it would appear on sensors on a wheel. The other is to pack and unpack a speed package under the ARINC standard.
