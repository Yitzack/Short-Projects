# Detination Simulation

I'm going to try to make a fluid simulation of an amount of TNT going off in a small concrete box.  The air is going to be a fluid simulation with Euler Equations for compressible fluid. The concrete is going to masses on springs. Accuracy is not gurenteed. It is likely to be quite hilarous when animated. 

## Compile directions for g++

To be determined.
