# Audio

I'm going to make a program that writes WAV files of audio. It will have a library of sources, effects, and then write out the results to a WAV.

## WAV file standard

The wave file standard can be found [here](https://www.mcternan.me.uk/MCS/Downloads/wave.pdf), [here](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/), and other places. The second one has an incorrect description of sample arrangement.

## Compile directions for g++

g++ Audio.cpp -O3
